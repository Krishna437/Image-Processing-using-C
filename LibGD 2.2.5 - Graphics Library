What is gd?
-------------
gd is a graphics library.  It allows your code to quickly draw images complete with lines, arcs, text, multiple colors, cut and paste from other images, and flood fills, and write out the result as a PNG or JPEG file.  This is particularly useful in World Wide Web applications, where PNG and JPEG are two of the formats accepted for inline images by most browsers.
gd is not a paint program.  If you are looking for a paint program, you are looking in the wrong place.  If you are not a programmer, you are looking in the wrong place, unless you are installing a required library in order to run an application.
gd does not provide for every possible desirable graphics operation.  It is not necessary or desirable for gd to become a kitchen-sink graphics package, but version 2.0 does include most frequently requested features, including both truecolor and palette images, resampling (smooth resizing of truecolor images) and so forth.

gd basics: using gd in your program
-----------------------------------
gd lets you create PNG or JPEG images on the fly.  To use gd in your program, include the file gd.h, and link with the gd library and the other required libraries; the syntax for most Unix flavors is:
-lgd -lpng -lz -ljpeg -lfreetype -lm
Assuming that all of these libraries are available.
